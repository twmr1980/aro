ARO Cash register project from WallacePOS.

12May2018:  created generic buttons for collecting all day coffee customer and one for their refills.  onClick currently calls prompt that presently leads to no where.  Need to add script to handle calls to and from db for tracking.  Also, todo for later:  auto add all day coffee to line items.
